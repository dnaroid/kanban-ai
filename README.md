# Kanban AI

Kanban AI is a kanban-style task manager with built-in AI task execution.

It allows tasks to be turned into runs, tracks their progress, supports follow-up questions during execution, and keeps the result tied to the task workflow.

## Features

- Kanban board for managing project tasks
- AI runs started directly from tasks
- Run status tracking and execution history
- Follow-up questions and pause/resume flow during execution
- Task state updates based on run results
- Role-based agent presets
- Context snapshots and linked task data
- SQLite-based local storage
- Optional Git worktree isolation for runs

## How it works

1. Create or open a project board.
2. Add tasks and organize them in the workflow.
3. Start an AI run for a task.
4. The system tracks the run and updates its status.
5. If the agent needs clarification, the run can pause and wait for user input.
6. When execution finishes, the result stays connected to the task and workflow.

## Quality Gates

| Linting | `pnpm lint` |
| Tests | `pnpm test:run` |

Additional tooling configured: [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) (`.prettierrc`), TypeScript strict mode.

## Git Worktrees

Git worktree support is **opt-in** and disabled by default. Set `RUNS_WORKTREE_ENABLED=true` to enable it.

When enabled, regular execution runs (mode `"execute"`) are isolated in a dedicated worktree — a separate working directory on its own branch — so changes don't affect the main project directory until explicitly merged. User Story generation and QA testing runs always execute in the main project directory and do not use worktrees.

When disabled (the default), all runs work directly in the main project directory.

After merging a completed run, the worktree and branch are cleaned up automatically. Cleanup is best-effort; if it fails (e.g., a process is still holding a file lock), manual cleanup may be needed.

See [docs/GIT_WORKTREES.md](docs/GIT_WORKTREES.md) for full details and troubleshooting.
